# cpp_modules
Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff.

The goal of these modules is an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of learning C++. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP, but since C++ is derived from C, it seems like a more proper choice.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
Modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. 
The exercises will progressively increase in complexity.
